My Notes on Machine Learning

Content

Neuron, SGD and GD: programmed a neuron (w/o activation function) from scratch using tensorflow and performed SGD, GD using the single neuron on a dataset

Finding Centroids and Classification: iteratively calculated centroids of clusters; Programmed a neuron (w activation function sigmoid) from scratch using tensorflow and performed logistic classification

NN,CNN,and GAN: programmed an NN, a CNN, and GAN using pytorch, and test them on classification of MNIST dataset
